### infinitive verb

- A verb in its basic form. It usually has the word "to" before it, but not always.

> I want to run.
> (The infinitive verb "to run" is not the main verb. "Want" is. The infinitive verb is being used as a noun.)

> I need someone to take notes.
> (The infinitive verb "to take" is not the main verb. "Need" is. The infinitive verb is being used as an adjective. It describes "someone". You could re-write the sentence as "I need someone that is prepared to take notes.")

> The officer returned to offer assistance.
> (The infinitive verb "to offer" is not the main verb. "Returned" is. The infinitive verb is being used as an adverb. It describes "returned". You could re-write the sentence as "The officer returned so he could help." In that sentence, "so he could offer assistance" is an adverbial clause. In our original sentence, "to offer assistance" does the same thing.

> I must tell the truth.
> (The infinitive verb "tell" is not the main verb. The "to" has been dropped because a modal verb comes before it. The modal verb "must" is the main verb.)

### bare infinitive verb

- An infinitive verb without the word "to" before it.

> I must tell the truth.
> (The bare infinitive verb "tell" is not the main verb. The "to" has been dropped because a modal verb comes before it. The modal verb "must" is the main verb.)

> I watched them bake bread.

> He ran behind the shed.
> (The past tense verb is "ran")

Form: will + V

> She will play tennis.
> (The future tense verb "will play" shows that tennis is something she will be doing sometime after now.)

### direct object

- The person or thing that verb acts on.

> I sent the postcard to Dad.

### indirect object

- The person or thing for whom the action was done.

> I sent the postcard to Dad.
> (The indirect object is "Dad". He is the person I was sending the postcard to.)

> I will bake him a cake.

### passive voice

- A sentence has a passive voice when the action is done to the subject, not done by the subject.

> The table was set.
> (This sentence is passive because the table didn't do the setting. The act of setting was done to the table.)

### conjugation

- Changing the verb so that it matches the subject. This must be memorized.

> I - am

### non-finite verb

- A verb that is not showing tense. This category is made up of gerunds, infinitives, and participles.

> She needs to go home.
> (The non-finite verb "to go" is an infinitive.)

> We ate the toasted marshmallows.
> (The non-finite verb "toasted" is a participle.)

### participle

- A verb that is used as an adjective. There are two types: present participle and past participle.

> This is the house of the rising sun.
> (The present participle "rising" is used to describe the noun "sun".)

> That cooked ham looks dry.

### adjective phrase

- A group of words that describes a noun. There must be an adjective in an adjective phrase.

> Sarah was fairly bored with the lesson.
> (The adjective phrase "fairly bored with the lesson" describes Sarah. It uses the linking verb "is" to connect the subject to the predicate.)

> The dog covered in mud looked pleased with himself.
> (The adjective phrase "covered in mud" describes the dog. The adjective phrase "pleased with himself" also describes the dog, but it uses the linking verb "looked" to connect to the subject.)

### attributive

- When the phrase is inside the noun phrase of the noun it modifies.

> The beautifully carved frames are worth more than the paintings.
> (The adjective phrase "The beautifully carved" is attributive because it is inside the noun phrase "The beautifully carved frames".)

### predicative

- When the phrase is outside the noun phrase of the noun it modifies. A predicative phrase is usually linked to the noun by a linking verb.

> The frames were beautifully carved by monks.
> (The adjective phrase "beautifully carved" is predicative because it is outside the noun phrase "The frames".)

### participle phrase

- An adjective phrase that starts with a participle.

> You could see the wild thing gnashing its teeth.
> (The participle phrase "gnashing its teeth" describes the wild thing. The word "gnashing" is a participle.)

> Rising out of the see, the dragon's scales glimmered in the sunlight.
> (The participle phrase "rising out of the sea" describes the dragon's scales. The word "rising" is a participle.)

### misplaced modifier

- A word, phrase, or clause that does not relate to what it was supposed to modify.

These types of errors can be fixed by moving the position of the modifier or rewording the sentence.

> He only eats ice cream.
> (He doesn't throw it? He doesn't roll in it? This is a common mistake. The correct sentence would be "He eats only ice cream." That way, "only" modifies the word "ice cream", not "eats".)

> Yoona told us after the holiday that she wants to stop smoking.
> (Did Yoona tell us this after the holiday? Or does she want to stop smoking after the holiday? It would be better to say "After the holiday, Yoona told us that she wants to stop smoking" or "Yoona told us that she wants to stop smoking after the holiday.")

> Running quickly improves your health.
> (Does running at a face pace improve health? Or does running improve your health quickly? This is a squinting modifier.)

> Having read your letter, my dog will be taken to the vet.
> (The dog didn't read the letter. Therefore, the correct sentence would read: "Having read your letter, I will take my dog to the vet." This is an example of a dangling modifier.)

### dangling modifier

- A type of misplaced modifier where there is nothing to modify.

> Having read your letter, my dog will be taken to the vet.
> (The dog didn't read the letter. Therefore, the correct sentence would read: "Having read your letter, I will take my dog to the vet.")

> Meticulous and punctual, David's work ethic is admirable.
> (David's work ethic is neither meticulous nor punctual; David is.)

### squinting modifier

- A type of misplaced modifier that could modify either the words before or the words after it. It can "look" left or right. If there is nothing to one of those sides, then it is a misplaced modifier.

> Taking a moment to think clearly improves your chances.
> (Are we "thinking clearly" or are we "clearly improving"?)

### limiting modifier

- A word that restricts the words it modifies.
    A limiting modifier usually modifies the word immediately to its right. The most common limiting modifiers are: almost, hardly, nearly, just, only, merely.

> Martin eats only pears.
> Almost everyone is asleep.
> Nearly four score and seven years ago, the constitution was ratified.

### gerund

- A verb that acts like a noun. Gerunds always end in -ing.

> Swimming is my favorite past-time.
> She doesn't like cooking.
> You can tell much about one's character by one's way of eating jellybeans.

### complement

- The word or words needed to complete the meaning of an expression. Complements cannot be removed from a sentence without changing the meaning.

> Martha is strong.
> (Strong tells us something about Martha, a noun. So "strong" is a subject complement.)

> The resolution made Jeff's position irrelevant.
> (Irrelevant tells us something about Jeff's position, an object. So "irrelevant" is an object complement.)

> The board cut Jeff's salary.
> (Jeff's salary tells us something about the verb "cut". This makes "Jeff's salary" an object... and an object complement. Why it is not called a "verb complement", we'll never know.)

> The board cut Jeff's salary.
> (The board tells us something about the verb "cut". This makes "The board" a subject... and a subject complement. Why it is not called a "verb complement", we'll never know.)

### linking verb

- A verb that connects the subject to the predicate and does not show an action.

Linking verbs are usually one of the five senses or the verb "to be". Remember that they cannot have a direct object.

> She smells like a gym class in July.
> (The linking verb "smells" connects the subject pronoun "she" to the predicate "like a gym class in July".)

> Siva's grandmother is a bartender.
> (The linking verb "is" connects the subject "Siva's grandmother" to the predicate "a bartender".)

### noun clause

- A clause that acts like a noun.

> I like what I see.
> (The noun clause is "what I see")

> I know that the tide is turning.
> (The noun clause is "that the tide is turning")

## sentence types

- There are four sentence types. You can remember them by the acronym I-DIE.

1.  Interrogative
2.  Declaritive
3.  Imperative
4.  Exclamitory

### Interrogative sentence:

- asks a question. Ends in a question mark.

> Where are you going?

### Declarative sentence:

- makes a statement. Ends in a period.

> I am going to the doctor.

### Imperative sentence:

- gives a command. Can end in a period or an exclamation mark.

> Do not touch the wall.

### Exclamatory sentence:

> Stop, thief!

### Sentence structures

- There are four of them.

### Complex Sentence:

- one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses.

> When you are young, you are invincible.

### Compound Sentence:

- two or more independent clauses.

> You don't like me but I don't care.

### Simple Sentence

- only one independent clause.

> Here's looking at you, kid.

### Compound-Complex Sentence

- at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

> If a doctor has good bedside manner, he should receive a promotion, but if he instills the fear of God in his patients, he should be demoted.

### run-on error

- When two or more independent clauses are connected by only a comma.

To fix this, change the comma to a full stop, semicolon, dash, or ellipsis.

> I didn't like Susan, she was always telling lies.
> ("I didn't like Susan; she was always telling lies," would fix this.)

### object of preposition

- The noun or pronoun the preposition is pointing to.

> This is one small step for a man.
> (The object of preposition is "man" since the preposition is "for". The word "a" is a modifier.)

> Inside every cynical person is a disappointed idealist.
> (The object of preposition is "person" since the preposition is "inside". The words "every cynical" are modifiers.)

### adverbial clause

- A clause that acts like an adverb. Adverbial clauses are adjuncts and are dependent.

> Keep hitting the gong until I tell you to stop.
> (The adverbial clause "until I tell you to stop" describes the verb "hitting". Therefore, it acts like an adverb.)

### hierarchy of word units

- The acronym to remember the hierarchy of word units is WPCSCC.

> Word (e.g., Shark)
> (A word is the smallest meaningful unit.)

> Phrase (e.g., A seven-foot tiger shark)
> (A phrase is a single piece of information made up of more than one word. It will not contain a subject and a verb.)

> Clause (e.g., When a seven-foot tiger shark arrived...)
> (A clause is a single piece of information made up of more than one word which contains a subject and a verb.)

> Sentence (e.g., A seven-foot tiger shark arrived.)
> (A sentence conveys a complete idea. It must contain at least one clause. Note: A clause that stands alone as a sentence is known as an independent clause.)

> Complex Sentence (e.g., When a seven-foot tiger shark arrived, the crew stopped fishing.)
> (A complex sentence is an independent clause supported by at least one other clause.)

> Compound Sentence (e.g., A seven-foot tiger shark arrived, and the crew stopped fishing.)
> (A compound sentence is a sentence made up of at least two independent clauses.)

### adjunct

- A word, phrase, or clause that can be removed from a sentence without making it grammatically incorrect. An adjunct is usually an adverb used to modify a verb.

> In the morning, we will leave for the countryside.
> (The adjective phrase "in the morning" is an adjunct.)

> She washes all of her dolls whenever Ollie washes his Legos.
> (The adjective phrase "whenever Ollie washes his Legos" is an adjunct.)

### adverb

- A word that tells us more about a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.

> He ran quickly.
> (The adverb "quickly" tells us more about the verb "ran")

> He ran to the shop.
> (The adverbial phrase "to the shop" tells us more about where he ran)

> Stephanie finished her assignment remarkably quickly.
> (The adverb "remarkably" tells us more about the adverb "quickly", which tells us more the verb "finished".)

### possessive pronouns

- These pronouns show ownership and do not modify nouns. They can be memorized: mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs.

> This house is mine.
> His is next door.

### objective case

- The case used for nouns and pronouns that are objects.

In English, only some pronouns change in the objective case. All nouns remain the same.

The accusative and dative cases encountered in other languages are one and the same in English: the objective case.

> me
> you
> him
> her
> it
> us
> them
> whom
> whomever

### adjective clause

- A clause that modifies a noun. It usually comes after the noun.

Put commas around the adjective clause if the information not needed to figure out what the noun is.

> The rat which you saw yesterday was infected.
> (The adjective clause "which you saw yesterday" describes the rat.)

> The rate you saw yesterday was infected.
> (The adjective clause "you saw yesterday" describes the rat. Notice that the relative pronoun was deleted yet the sentence is still grammatical.)

> My brother, who had sprained his ankle moments earlier, sprinted after the bus.
> (The adjective phrase "who had sprained his ankle moments earlier" is not required to figure out who "my brother" is.)

### affix

- Letters added to the root of a word to change its meaning. If the letters are added before the root, they are called a prefix. If the letters are added after the root, they are called a suffix.

> Homogenized - the prefix "homo" has been added
> Incapable - the prefix "in" has been added
> Laughing - the suffix "ing" has been added

### alliteration

Restrictive clauses usually begin with "which", "that", and "who".

> He has no dogs.
> (The determiner "no" shows amount.)

> I love those dogs!
> (The determiner "those" is a demonstrative adjective. It shows specificity.)

> I want a dog.
> (The determiner "a" is an article. It shows definiteness.)

### indefinite adjective

- Tells us more about a noun in a non-specific way.

> However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do to you if you do not act upon them?
> (The first "many" is an indefinite adjective as it describes "holy words". The second "many" is an indefinite pronoun as it stands on its own.)

### possessive adjective

- A word that tells us who owns the noun.

You can memorize them: my, your, his, her, its, their, our, whose.

> That is her dog.
> (The possessive adjective "her" shows us it is she who owns the dog. Do note that if we mentioned the girl's name earlier, this "her" would also be considered a pronoun since it takes the place of the girl's name.)

### demonstrative adjective

You can memorize them: this, that, these, those.

> These pencils are hers.
> (The demonstrative adjective "these" refers to the pencils.)

> That is dirty!
> (The demonstrative adjective "that" does not describe a noun.)

### aspect

- The part of a verb that tells us if the action is still going on or if it has finished.

There are four aspects: simple (AKA indefinite), perfect (AKA complete), progressive (AKA continuous), and perfect progressive.

> He took the photos.
> (simple aspect - no emphasis of completed or on-going action)

> He had taken the photos by the time the owner arrived.
> (perfect aspect - action completed)

> He was taking the photos when the owner arrived.
> (progressive aspect - action on going)

> He had been taking the photos before the owner arrived.
> (perfect progressive aspect - action on going but then finished)

These sentences are all in the past tense, but they all have a different aspect. Remember, we need aspect to tell us whether the action was on-going or completed.

### assonance

> The cat in the hat sat on a bat.
> I keep my eye on the prize.
> Love lunges from the heart.

### helping verb

## case

- This shows a noun's or pronoun's relationship to the other words in the sentence. There are only four cases in Modern English:

1.  subjective
2.  objective
3.  possessive
4.  vocative

The noun doesn't change in any of them, other than getting 's in the possessive form.

The pronoun doesn't have a vocative case. Otherwise, it usually changes in the other three cases.

### subjective case

- The case for a noun or pronoun when it is the subject.

### possessive case

- The case for a noun or pronoun when it shows that it owns something.

### vocative case

- The case for a noun when it is being directly talked to. The noun doesn't change from its regular form. It should have commas around it.

> Paul, is this yours?
> ("Paul" is in the vocative case)

### coordinate conjunction

- A conjunction that joins two or more like with like. For example, adjective with adjectives, nouns with nouns, phrases with phrases, etc.
